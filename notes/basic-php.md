# Introduction to PHP Programming Language

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source scripting language mainly used for web development. It is embedded in HTML and runs on the server side, making it suitable for dynamic web applications.

## Features of PHP
- **Simplicity**: Easy to learn and use.
- **Flexibility**: Works well with databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.
- **Server-Side Execution**: PHP scripts execute on the server, and only the output is sent to the browser.
- **Integration**: Can be embedded within HTML and works well with JavaScript, AJAX, and CSS.

## Basic Syntax

### 1. PHP Tags
PHP code is written inside `<?php ... ?>` tags.

```php
<?php
    echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### 2. Variables
PHP variables start with `$` and do not require explicit type declarations.

```php
<?php
    $name = "Fairus";
    $age = 30;
    echo "My name is $name and I am $age years old.";
?>
```

**Output:**
```
My name is Fairus and I am 30 years old.
```

### 3. Comments
```php
// This is a single-line comment
# This is also a single-line comment
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
*/
```

### 4. Data Types
```php
<?php
    $string = "Hello";  // String
    $integer = 10;      // Integer
    $float = 10.5;      // Float
    $boolean = true;    // Boolean
    $array = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]; // Array
?>
```

### 5. Control Structures

#### If-Else Statement
```php
<?php
    $x = 10;
    if ($x > 5) {
        echo "X is greater than 5";
    } else {
        echo "X is less than or equal to 5";
    }
?>
```

#### Switch Statement
```php
<?php
    $day = "Monday";
    switch ($day) {
        case "Monday":
            echo "Start of the week!";
            break;
        case "Friday":
            echo "Weekend is coming!";
            break;
        default:
            echo "It's just another day.";
    }
?>
```

#### Loops
**For Loop**
```php
<?php
    for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
        echo "Number: $i <br>";
    }
?>
```

**While Loop**
```php
<?php
    $i = 1;
    while ($i <= 5) {
        echo "Count: $i <br>";
        $i++;
    }
?>
```

### 6. Functions
PHP functions are defined using the `function` keyword.
```php
<?php
    function greet($name) {
        return "Hello, $name!";
    }

    echo greet("Fairus");
?>
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Fairus!
```

### 7. Arrays
```php
<?php
    $fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
    echo $fruits[1]; // Output: Banana

    foreach ($fruits as $fruit) {
        echo "$fruit <br>";
    }
?>
```

### 8. Associative Arrays
```php
<?php
    $person = ["name" => "Fairus", "age" => 30];
    echo $person["name"]; // Output: Fairus
?>
```

### 9. Superglobals
- `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_SESSION`, `$_COOKIE`, `$_SERVER` are used for form handling, sessions, cookies, and server data.

```php
<?php
    echo $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']; // Displays the server name
?>
```

### 10. Database Connection (MySQL Example using PDO)
```php
<?php
    try {
        $pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydatabase", "root", "password");
        echo "Connected successfully!";
    } catch (PDOException $e) {
        echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
    }
?>
```

## Conclusion
PHP is a powerful yet easy-to-learn language, making it great for beginners and experienced developers. It supports object-oriented programming, frameworks like Laravel, and integration with databases and front-end technologies.
